# Tile Generation
# Generating a random map in crawlr is easy with the tile generating variables
# below.
[Tiles]

# regions
# 'regions' is used to select a different group of random monsters.
# For each tile, one of the regions defined below will be chosen.
# This allows you to greatly control the chance of a battle's toughness.
# If you would like to have a map with a bunch of weak monsters, and a slight
# possibility of 1 really strong monster, you can set 'regions' to something
# like: regions = '11111111111111111112'. Then in the [Monsters] section, you
# can set the weak monsters for group 1, and the strong monster for group 2.
# With this, each tile will have a 1 in 20 chance of having a battle from
# monster group 2.
# Default: 1

regions = 1

# terrains
# 'terrains' is used to select a terrain type for each tile.
# For each tile, one of the terrain types defined below will be chosen.
# If you would like to have a map that is mostly grassy, and a slight chance
# for forests, you can set 'terrains' to something like:
# terrains = "gggggf". With this, there will be a 1 in 6 chance of a tile
# being a forest.
# Default: gggggf

terrains = "gggggf"

# objects
# 'objects' is used to select a terrain object available on that specific
# terrain type.
# If you would like to draw a rock or a tree once in a while, you can set
# something like the following:
# objects  = "........................................b"
# All terrains have the "." object, which tells crawlr not to draw any object
# at all. It should be used to pad the objects like above so that objects do
# not litter the map.
# Available objects:
objects  = "............................................b"
