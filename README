A 2D dungeon exploration game in the early stages of development. The game will
have a look and feel similar to classic 16-bit console games.

NOTE: This is a development version of the game. It may or may not contain
      features and bugs not present in the final version. Infact, it is very
      incomplete at the moment. Please report bugs/requests to GitHub.

*******************************************************************************

INSTALLATION

First, be sure you have version 2.6+ of Python, and 1.8+ of the PyGame library.
Older versions may work, but have not been thoroughly tested. To play the game,
change to the directory where you unpacked the game and run:

python play.py

*******************************************************************************

CREATING A CUSTOM MAP

You can create your own map for the game with a simple map configuration file.
Read the documentation in the doc/MAP_CREATION file for instructions.

*******************************************************************************

TODO

*   When loading a map, unobstrusively display the area name in a fancy font
    for a couple of seconds and then fade it out.
