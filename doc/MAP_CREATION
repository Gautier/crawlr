CUSTOM MAP CREATION

You can create a custom map for the game with a simple map configuration file.
The file should have a ".map" filename extension and be in the map format
described below.

The following is an example of a map file with comments explaining the various
options:


[Options]

# Tileset graphics to use. Currently only 'world' is valid.
tile_set = world

# The size of the individual tiles within the tileset.
tile_size = 32,32

# The size of the map in tiles, in the format width,height.
num_tiles = 88,23

# The map tile where the player starts, in the format x,y.
start_tile = 85,1

# This is the direction the player is facing when entering the map.
start_direction = left

[Tiles]

# 'regions' is used to select a different group of random monsters. For each
# tile, one of the regions defined below will be chosen. This allows you to
# greatly control the chance of a battle's toughness. If you would like to have
# a map with a bunch of weak monsters, and a slight possibility of 1 really
# strong monster, you can set this to: regions = 1111111111111111112. Then
# in the [Monsters] section, you can set the weak monsters for group 1, and the
# strong monster for group 2. With this, each tile will have a 1 in 20 chance
# of having a battle from monster group 2.
# Valid values: any integer between 1-9
regions = 1112

# 'terrains' is used to select a terrain type for each tile. For each tile, one
# of the terrain types defined below will be chosen. If you would like to have
# a map that is mostly grassy, and a slight chance for forests, you can set
# this to: terrains = ggggf
# With this, there will be a 1/6 chance of a tile being a forest.
# Valid values: g, f
terrains = ggggf

# 'objects' is used to select a terrain object available on that specific
# terrain type. If you would like to draw a rock or a tree on the grass once in
# a while, you can set this to:
# objects_grass = 50, abcde
# If you would like that 'tree 1' be more common, you can define it more than
# once: objects_grass = 50, abccccde
# Available objects:
#   grass:
#       a: rock 1
#       b: rock 2
#       c: tree 1
#       d: tree 2
#       e: tree 3
#   forest:
#       a: tree 1
#       b: tree 2
#       c: tree 3
#       d: tree 4
#       e: tree 5
#       f: tree 6
#       g: bush 1
#       h: bush 2
#       i: bush 3
#       j: bush 4
#       k: bush 5
#       l: bush 6
#       m: bush 7
#       n: bush 8
#       o: mushroom
objects_grass  = 2, ab
objects_forest = 50, abcghijklmno

[Monsters]

# For each region number defined in the tiles section, specify a group of
# monsters for that region.

# Region 1 is set most of the time above, so we'll allow some weak monsters:
1 = Slug, Hawk

# Region 2 is set only 25% of the time, so we'll allow some even more
# powerful monsters here:
2 = Slug, Hawk, MagiSlug, PoisonSlug
