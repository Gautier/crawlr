A 2D dungeon exploration game in the early stages of development. The game will
have a look and feel similar to classic 16-bit console games.

NOTE: This is a development version of the game. It may or may not contain
      features and bugs not present in the final version.

*******************************************************************************

INSTALLATION

First, be sure you have version 2.6+ of Python, and 1.8+ of the Pygame library.
Older versions may work, but have not been thoroughly tested. To play the game,
change to the directory where you unpacked the game and run:

python play.py

*******************************************************************************

MAP CREATION

Basic support for generating a map by writing some values to a configuration
file has been added. If you would like to create your own map, read the
doc/MAP_CREATION file for help, and edit data/maps/map1.map to your liking.

*******************************************************************************

IDEAS

These are some minor ideas I had that I'll try to squeeze in once in a while
when I need a change of focus.

*   Tiny face icon of each party member with tiny stats using the 'gui' font.
    Text should be white with a black shadow for readability.

*   When loading a map, display area name in a fancy font for a couple seconds
    and then fade it out.
