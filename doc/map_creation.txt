# Tile Generation
# Generating a random map in crawlr is easy with the tile generating variables
# below.
[Tiles]

# regions
# 'regions' is used to select a different group of random monsters.
# For each tile, one of the regions defined below will be chosen.
# This allows you to greatly control the chance of a battle's toughness.
# If you would like to have a map with a bunch of weak monsters, and a slight
# possibility of 1 really strong monster, you can set 'regions' to something
# like: regions = '11111111111111111112'. Then in the [Monsters] section, you
# can set the weak monsters for group 1, and the strong monster for group 2.
# With this, each tile will have a 1 in 20 chance of having a battle from
# monster group 2.

regions = "1"

# terrains
# 'terrains' is used to select a terrain type for each tile.
# For each tile, one of the terrain types defined below will be chosen.
# If you would like to have a map that is mostly grassy, and a slight chance
# for forests, you can set 'terrains' to something like:
# terrains = "gggggf". With this, there will be a 1 in 6 chance of a tile
# being a forest.

terrains = "gggggf"

# objects
# 'objects' is used to select a terrain object available on that specific
# terrain type.
# If you would like to draw a rock or a tree on the grass once in a while, you
# can set something like the following:
# objects_grass = ".......................................abcde"
# If you would like that 'tree 1' be more common, you can define it more than
# once:
# objects_grass = ".......................................abccccde"
# All terrains have the "." object, which tells the game not to draw any object
# at all. This is only the chance there will be no object, so it is necessary
# to pad each terrain's objects with a few empty objects so that objects do not
# litter the map.
# Available objects:
#   grass:
#       a: rock 1
#       b: rock 2
#       c: tree 1
#       d: tree 2
#       e: tree 3
#   forest:
#       a: tree 1
#       b: tree 2
#       c: tree 3
#       d: tree 4
#       e: tree 5
#       f: tree 6
#       g: bush 1
#       h: bush 2
#       i: bush 3
#       j: bush 4
#       k: bush 5
#       l: bush 6
#       m: bush 7
#       n: bush 8
#       o: mushroom
